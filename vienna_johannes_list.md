# Johannes Grenzfurthner list of things in Vienna 
# annotated and reordered a bit by Rich Gibson

[Johannes' original list](https://www.facebook.com/notes/johannes-grenzfurthner/vienna-sightseeing-recommendations/10152348245184610)

## Museums

- Museum of Natural History. It's really good. (And look for Honzo: http://www.monochrom.at/honzo )
- Technical Museum (they have a lot of cool stuff and machinery)
- Narrenturm, the Museum for Medical Pathology (but take the tour, it's only good with a tour. And they are only open Wednesday and Thursday) (rlg: I have never been, but many people have told me about it)


## Food/Beverage

- Figlmüller Schnitzel (awesome; best with a potato/field salad) (rlg: I second this)
- Plachutta - ONLY for "Tafelspitz" which is basically traditional austrian boiled beef which is almost impossible to make right, but it's good there (rlg: I like Tafelspitz a lot, and it is good here.)
- Demel (one of the best coffee places; touristy, but great cakes; I also recommend the chili hot chocolate)
- Restaurant Waldviertelhof (Schoenbrunnerstrasse 20; a good variety of Austrian specialities)
- Glacisbeisl (that's in Museumsquartier; they have the best Grammelknödel in Vienna; try em!)
- Heuriger (classic Viennese wine tavern; I recommend this one in town: http://www.restauranttester.at/weinstube-josefstadt.html )
- Cafe Korb (good coffee shop; arty backstory; many Viennese artists of the 60s went there)
- Sofitel Vienna: LE LOFT Lounge (great bar, great view; was designed by Pipilotti Rist)
- Werkzeug H - good hipster cafe, run by friends of ours (they would of course hate that I call it "hipster")
- Cafe PHIL - good hip cafe, and also a bookstore and you can buy the furniture as well  (rlg: I like Phil's)
- Pub Klemo wine bar and wine shop (owner is brit, very nice, go talk to her.  http://www.pubklemo.at/ )


## Places
- Museumsquartier (that's where our monochrom office is; try to find the office of ESEL - Lorenz Seidler - he is a great guy and can give you hints about cool art events in town; he hosts a curated list for great events on esel.at)


- Cobenzl or Kahlenberg (go up the mountain with the bus from U4 Heiligenstadt, it's a gorgeous view)

- The Prater, the old Viennese amusement park (if you have time go and eat the pig's leg at Schweizerhaus; super-yummie)(rlg: The Lliputbahn is super cute)

- Flex (a bigger indie club in Vienna, good concerts; it's in the first district alongside the Danube channel; if you walk alongside the Danube channel from Flex you will see tons of great graffiti; it's one of the legal walls in Vienna)

- Metalab (the Viennese hackerspace; great location; talk to them, they talk back) (rlg: obviously I 
highly recommend the Metalab)

- Catacombs of St. Stephen's Cathedral (tour every 30 minutes) rlg: I've done this tour twice, and the quality varies based on the size of the group. A smaller group is better.)

- Burg Cinema (2-3 times a week they show "The Third Man"; a classic from the 1940s, go see it))(rlg: the 
Third Man was shot in post WWII vienna, and the damaged city is so present as to almost 
be another character. Seeing the movie in Vienna is cool)

- Schoenbrunn Castle (always good for a walk; go up the hill and check out Gloriette)

- Spartacus (downstairs at Sex World at Mariahilferstrasse; great selection of festishware and outfits, if you like that kind of stuff; some of the stuff is even wearable in non-kinky contexts ;) ) (rlg: upstairs is a vanila 
sex shop, and downstairs it has some heavy Mr S. vibes. It is also right on the main shopping
street of Mariahilfer Strasse, so the juxtaposition is delightful.  Mariahilfer Str. 36/40, 1070 Wien, Austria)

- Central Cemetery (the Zentralfriedhof; it's so big, it has its own forestry service; it's pretty much a gorgeous park full of dead folks; Beethoven, Falco, Schrödinger, you name it; you can go there with the tram line 71; http://www.friedhoefewien.at/eportal/ep/channelView.do/pageTypeId/13576/channelId/-26733 ) (rlg: In Vienna saying that someone 'took the 71' means that they died)

- Aida (it's a chain of cheap but really good pastry shops; they have great Punschkrapferl; eat one, and that's probably enough)

- United Nations (yes, Vienna is one of the 3 centers of the United Nations; UNO City is on the other side of the Danube, in Kagran, but can easily be reached with U1; UN tour is pretty cool)

- Shopping at Siebensterngasse, Kirchengasse, Neubaugasse and environs (7th district)

- MotMot - tshirts (owners are friends of ours)

- Standing-room tickets at the Opera: have never done this yet but if you want to go see an Opera and have more time than money it's worth looking into.  there are websites that explain the process... which is apparently a bit confusing.  and you don't have to dress up.

- Spanish Riding School - fancy horses  http://www.srs.at/en/ (The guided tour and/or morning exercises are more affordable than the full performances)
