## Ninth District

- Hundertwasser incinerator
  Take the U4 or U6 to Spittelau, look out and you will see the Hundertwasser
  designed incinerator.

- Sigmund Freud Museum
  Berggasse 19, 1090 Wien, Austria

  It is worth walking by the museum to see American psychiatrists wearing fanny
  packs taking pictures of each other in front of the museum.

  Take the D tram to the Schlickgasse tram stop. 
  Gasthaus Rebhuhn, on the corner of Berggasse, is a nice place to sit outside.
  Or go up to Servitengasse, which is a narrow tree lined streets with pleasent
  places to sit.

- [Der Wiener Deewan](deewan.at)
  Liechtensteinstraße 10, 1090 Wien, Austria

  Two blocks from the Freud museum. Pakistani food buffet, it is 'pay as you
  wish.' I like the food well enough, but vegitarian's and vegans who I
  know absolutely love it.


## Tenth District

- Reumanplatz -  

- [Amalienbad](https://www.wien.gv.at/freizeit/baeder/uebersicht/hallenbaeder/amalienbad.html)

  next to Reumanplatz. Pool and sauna. I have not been to it, but it looks similar
  to the one that I have been in.

  You want to use some caution that you are in the right place on the right day, but
  normally the saunas are naked and coed.

- [Viktor Adler Markt]()
  Viktor-Adler-Markt, 1100 Wien, Austria

  Walk North up Favoritenstraße from the Reumanplatz U-Bahn station for two blocks, 
  and it is a square block of market stalls.

  It is wonderful.  On an adjoining street, whose name escapes me, there is a 
  real farmer's market. You might find it.
 


## Nineteenth District Döbling

Vienna is the only city in the world (or so I have been told) that has active
vineyards within the city limits. 

- [Red Vienna at the Waschsalon](https://dasrotewien-waschsalon.at/startseite)
  Heiligenstädter Str. 82/92, 1190 Wien, Austria
  Vienna had a Social Democratic government from 1919-1934, and there is a lot
  to learn and understand about this period.

  When I went, there were few resources in English, but the exhibits were still worthwhile. 
  It looks like there are at least some more resources in English.

  The museum is in the Karl Marx Hof, one of the longest residential buildings in the world.

  Take the U4 to Heiligenstadt, or the D Tram to Halteraugasse

- Cobenzl or Kahlenberg 
  Hiking trails, gorgeous views, and some history to boot. 
  From the Heiligenstadt U4 station take the 38A. We went·
  all the way to [Kalenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahlenberg) and then we came back on the bus
  to Cobenzl. and had a snack at Rondell Café am Cobenzl. 

  Kahlenberg is where Polish troops were when they helped to relieve the city from 
  the Turks in the second seige of Vienna in 1683. The church is Polish, and has many
  markers of the event.

  Troops rushed down from Kahlenberg down towards the city walls. I have trouble
  walking across the parking lot. Rushing down the mountain fully armed 
  seems worth a bit of commemoration.

  Fun fact. The combined forces that drove off the Turks after several months
  of seige left them in such disarray that they left many of their supply wagons, 
  including bags of coffee. And the Wieners took to coffee.

  [A history of Viennese coffee house culture](https://www.wien.gv.at/english/culture-history/viennese-coffee-culture.html)

  "In 2011, Viennese coffee house culture was included by the UNESCO in the 
  national inventory of intangible cultural heritage."

- [Rondell Café am Cobenzl](https://weitsichtcobenzl.at/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023_04_05_rondell_menu_a4_de_web.pdf)
  The art and decorations, and the views, are great.

## Twentieth District Brigittenau
## Twenty-first District Florisdorf


- Danube, Donauinsel, FKK beaches 

  - U-Bahn to the Danube
  U6 to Neue Donau
  U1 to Donauinsel station
  U2 to Donaustadtbrücke station (or Donaumarina for the Danube side)

  The Danube historically has defined Vienna. Flood control measures were
  taken that straightened the channel, created the Donauinsel, and the 
  semi-lagoon the NeueDonau. 

  Take the U2 to Donaustadtbrücke station and walk north west and watch 
  people wake board on what looks like an aquatic ski lift.

  Cross over to the Donauinsel, the 21 km long island created as a side
  effect of flood control work, and which is now crisscrossed with bicycle
  and walking trails and lots of entertaining places.

  Or follow the bike path to a FKK (Freikörperkultur-Free body culture, nude)
  beach. (google for their locations)

  There are bike rental spots along the NeueDonau, and lots of bike paths.
  If you rent a bike, the Dechantlacke is an awesome swimming lake.


## Excursions

 more intimate versions.
